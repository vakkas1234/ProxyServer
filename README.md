Hi friends, I made a proxy server. 
##Setup
You need to download http-proxy.
Code
```bash
npm install http-proxy
```
Then 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vakkas1234/ProxyServer.git
```
After that, 
You can open the Proxy Server code with any compiler.
I prefer Visual Studio Code
Finally,
You have to open the terminal on the Visual Studio Code.
Then 
```bash
node index.js
```
and it will work
After it works, you can see http://localhost:3000/posts on the stage.
##Additonally
You can change the target URL in the code stage.
